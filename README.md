# Cosmote TV Endpoins

### A List containing Cosmote TV endpoints for use in proxies and policy routing

I created this list after trial and error while trying to troubleshoot issues when streaming via Starlink.
If you are like me, you probably would need these endpoints to route Cosmote TV traffic via another provider or VPN to make to work.
As this is a list I made by going through packet captures it might be incomplete, so feel free to create a PR to add any endpoints I'm missing.
